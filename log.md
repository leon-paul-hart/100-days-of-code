# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: May 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Publicly committed to the task at my Github.io blog at <https://leon-paul-hart.github.io/>. I set up the blog in Jekyll on Github a while back, but it's finally been put to use today as I don't have twitter or other social media to post to.

**Thoughts:** I think the hardest part for me has been committing to this challenge and starting the ball rolling, for various reasons detailed in my blog post here <https://leon-paul-hart.github.io/blog/adhd/neurodiversity/2020/05/20/ADHD-and-the-100-days-of-code-challenge.html> extended endeavours like this can be problematic for me. With work taking up alot of my energy too its hard spending a whole day coding and coming back home to do more! But I'm feeling inspired by the latest Microsoft Build conference and I'm excited to get stuck in while the inspirtation is flowing, hope I can keep it up if the inspiration starts to falter!
